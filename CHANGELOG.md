# Change Log

## [0.5.0](https://github.com/graphql-community/ApolloAlamofire/tree/0.5.0) (2019-07-12)

This release adds support for Carthage package manager.

**Merged pull requests:**

- Add Carthage support [\#5](https://github.com/graphql-community/ApolloAlamofire/pull/5) ([ciminuv](https://github.com/ciminuv))

## [0.4.0](https://github.com/graphql-community/ApolloAlamofire/tree/0.4.0) (2019-04-07)

This update fixes compatibility with Xcode 10.2 and Swift 5.0. This release
also supports Swift 4.2 and Xcode 10.0 and 10.1, but unfortunately maintaining
a suite of tests and Xcode project settings that support Swift 4.0 and Xcode 9
as well does not seem feasible (PRs that fix this are welcome!).

No other changes were made and ApolloAlamofire 0.3.0 is recommended if you need
Xcode 9 support.

**Closed issues:**

- Xcode 10.2 & Swift 5.0 compatibility [\#2](https://github.com/graphql-community/ApolloAlamofire/issues/2)
